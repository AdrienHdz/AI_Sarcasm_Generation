# AI_Sarcasm_Generation
The purpose of this project were to build neural network algorithms that will be used in the ﬁeld of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in order to ﬁt a speciﬁc dataset of human interactions.
Deep learning algorithms have been increasingly outperforming more traditional models in the past years in the task of text and language generation. Thus, we tried to employ diﬀerent deep learning models in order to generate sarcastic sentences responding to neutral input comments written by humans.
All the experiments we conducted during this project were based on past study that mostly try to classify sarcastic comment. Therefore, it were a dataset already cleaned of sarcastic comments that we didn’t need to werete time on data gathering.
During this project, many considerations were carefully analyzed in order to decide the usability of models and their parameters. Indeed, the generated sentences needed it to be syntactically and grammatically acceptable, as well as correlated to the input sentence meaning. That being said, the neutral input sentences were very important if we wanted our model to be useful. However, these constraints were particularly diﬃcult to respect in the context of sarcasm generation.
